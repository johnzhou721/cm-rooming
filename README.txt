Code to sort people into rooms for a field trip at school.  For internal use only, just trying to be transparent w/ my math teacher about what's in the scripts attached to the workbooks I share with her.

Some minimal docs is at man.pdf.

Another thing: To separate the rooms after a bunch of grouping is already done a greedy algorithm is used that is NOT optimal but still sorta works that picks the 4 (or any # of people / room) people that when taken apart from the people that doesn't have rooms yet, breaks the least amount of constraints and put them in the room. So please I'm just telling you this is NOT going to work very well.

Docs in man.pdf.
