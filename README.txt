This is not meant for use in ANYTHING. I'm just keeping track of random spaghetti code I wrote 1 year ago for a school teacher to arrange rooms on a field trip with several requirements that is probably not worth documenting publicly. I want to be able to have those code put in a safe, public place, but I'm not providing any documentation, it's written cryptically, the codes are used with VBA macros and Office Scripts for two different stages of the process, and it's absolute spaghetti and I just hacked those together for one very specific occasion to use at school. For anyone stumbling upon this page, you can see which type of spaghetti code was written by me, and that's it.
