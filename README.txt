This is not meant for use in ANYTHING. I'm just keeping track of random spaghetti code I wrote 1 year ago (time of writing: 13 years old) for a school teacher to arrange rooms on a field trip with several requirements that is probably not worth documenting publicly. I want to be able to have those code put in a safe, public place, but I'm not providing any documentation for now, it's written cryptically, the codes are used with VBA macros and Office Scripts for two different stages of the process, and it's absolute spaghetti and I just hacked those together for one very specific occasion to use at school. For anyone stumbling upon this page, you can see which type of spaghetti code was written by me, and that's it.

In the setup-script folder you will find a script to setup the inputs for the FIRST PART of the program only. I would like to disclose a bunch more details but I don't have time to, and another reason is to prevent people from adapting this spaghetti into anything else.

Another thing: To separate the rooms after a bunch of grouping is already done a greedy algorithm is used that is NOT optimal but still sorta works that picks the 4 (or any # of people / room) people that when taken apart from the people that doesn't have rooms yet, breaks the least amount of constraints and put them in the room. So please I'm just telling you this is NOT going to work very well.
