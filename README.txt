This is not meant for use in ANYTHING. I'm just keeping track of random spaghetti code I wrote 1 year ago (time of writing: 13 years old) for a school teacher to arrange rooms on a field trip.

Some minimal docs is at man.pdf.

Another thing: To separate the rooms after a bunch of grouping is already done a greedy algorithm is used that is NOT optimal but still sorta works that picks the 4 (or any # of people / room) people that when taken apart from the people that doesn't have rooms yet, breaks the least amount of constraints and put them in the room. So please I'm just telling you this is NOT going to work very well.
